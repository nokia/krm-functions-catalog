var KubeconformShort = `The ` + "`" + `kubeconform` + "`" + ` function wraps the [` + "`" + `kubeconform` + "`" + `] binary to validate resources
against their [json schemas].

This function is often used in the following scenarios:

- Validating resources as part of the local development workflow.
- Validating resources in CI.`
var KubeconformLong = `
The function configuration must be a ConfigMap.

The following keys can be used in the ` + "`" + `data` + "`" + ` field of the ConfigMap, and all of
them are optional:

- ` + "`" + `schema_location` + "`" + `: The base URI used to fetch the json schemas. 
  This feature only works with imperative runs, since declarative runs
  allow neither network access nor volume mount.
- ` + "`" + `additional_schema_locations` + "`" + `: List of secondary base URIs used to fetch the
  json schemas. These URIs will be used if the URI specified
  by ` + "`" + `schema_location` + "`" + ` did not have the required schema. The default is empty.
  This feature only works with imperative runs.
- ` + "`" + `ignore_missing_schemas` + "`" + `: Skip validation for resources without a schema. The
  default is ` + "`" + `false` + "`" + `.
- ` + "`" + `skip_kinds` + "`" + `: Comma-separated list of case-sensitive kinds to skip when
  validating against schemas. The default is empty.
- ` + "`" + `strict` + "`" + `: Disallow additional properties that are not in the schemas. The
  default is ` + "`" + `false` + "`" + `.

The following is an example function configuration:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: my-func-config
  data:
    schema_location: "file:///abs/path/to/your/schema/directory"
    additional_schema_locations: "https://kubernetesjsonschema.dev,file:///abs/path/to/your/other/schema/directory"
    ignore_missing_schemas: "false"
    skip_kinds: "DaemonSet,MyCRD"
    strict: "true"

If neither ` + "`" + `schema_location` + "`" + ` nor ` + "`" + `additional_schema_locations` + "`" + ` is provided, 
the default baked-in schema will be used for validaton. The existing baked-in 
schema was taken from the master branch of the [kubernetes-json-schema](https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/)
repository, at [this commit](https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/commit/44df5137d11c91d2ab3311b42745d1ff37fda888).
